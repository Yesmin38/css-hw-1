    <h1>How Apeel Works</h1>
    <h3>You can’t see it or taste it, but this peel is powerful</h3>
    <p>Apeel adds a layer of tasteless, odorless, plant-based protection on the surface <br> of fruits and
         vegetables. 
        This helps keep moisture in and oxygen out, which <br> means produce lasts twice as long.</p>

    <h2>We work with nature to reduce food waste and create abundance for all</h2>
    <p class="row"><span>And just how do we do that? Apeel uses materials that exist in the peels, seeds, and pulp of all fruits and vegetables to create a protective extra peel that seals moisture in and keeps oxygen out. That means our produce stays fresh, nutritious, and delicious twice as long. It also means less produce goes to waste throughout the supply chain—from grower to retailer to consumers at home. Less waste for you means less waste for the planet and a more abundant future for us all.
